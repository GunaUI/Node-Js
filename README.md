# Node-Js
## what is nodejs?
Node js is a javascript runtime.

## What does this means ??

* You know javascript, it's a programming language you typically use in the browser to manipulate your dom, to manipulate the page which was loaded in the browser,

* Javascript is a language that runs in the browser that allows you to interact with the page after it was loaded and it therefore is a crucial part when it comes to building interactive user interfaces in the browser

*  However javascript is not limited to that.

* Node js is a different version of javascript you could say, it is basically built on javascript, it adds some features to it, is not capable of doing some other things you can do with javascript in the browser

* so it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment.It allows you to run javascript code on the server you could say, in theory not just on the server but on any machine though. So it basically allows you to run javascript not just in the browser but anywhere else like a normal programming language.

* So in detail, this means that we can use node js to run javascript outside of the browser, that is the core takeaway,

## How does this work technically?

* Node js uses v8 and v8 simply is the name of the javascript engine built by Google that runs javascript in the browser

## what does an engine mean?

* Well it simply means that engine takes javascript code, the code running in your browser.

* in node's case which builds up on v8, it takes that javascript code and compiles it to machine code and this is what your browser does too,

* It does take your javascript code and compile it to machine code because that is the code that runs ultimately on your computer

* Node js basically takes that v8 codebase which is written in C++ and adds certain features like for example working with your local file system, opening files, reading files, deleting files, these are all things which are not possible in the browser,

## The REPL

*   Read    =====>  reading user input
*   Eval    =====>  evaluating user input
*   Print   =====>  outputting a result 
*   Loop    =====>  for returning and waiting for new input
